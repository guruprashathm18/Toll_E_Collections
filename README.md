# Toll_E_Collections

We can see that so many people are traveling in their vehicles. As we traveling, we can find the number of toll gates on the way. We find it very difficult to wait in the queue for such a long time. At present, manual toll collection is the most widely used collection method in the world. Due to manual intervention, the processing time at toll plazas is highest. Traffic congestion at Toll plazas leads to a huge economical loss in terms of fuel wastage and also causes pollution.

This project would help us by paying the amount for toll gates. We can pay the amount before we head for the journey. In this system user will give their travelling details then they select the tolls which they want to pay then they will make payment. This process will happen before they head for journey. If the user wants to move from one place to another they can pay for all tolls or they can pay for particular tolls in this system.
